Duby is a highly customizable programming language (or a structured assembly language) featuring type inference 
and a heavily Ruby-inspired syntax, while allowing both the inference engine and the compiler backends to be 
entirely customizable for any platform or type system. Duby currently includes a typer/compiler backend for the 
JVM.

This project depends on JRuby (since it still uses the parser) and on JVMScript.

JRuby is at http://www.jruby.org
JVMScript is at http://kenai.com/projects/jvmscript
